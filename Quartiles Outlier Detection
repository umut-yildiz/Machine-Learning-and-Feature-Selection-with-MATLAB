%% Grubbs Outlier Detection
function [Outlier,Feature,Observation] = GrubbsOutlierDetection(dataset)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description:
%       - This function is one of the Outlier Detection Methods.
%       - Applies Grubbs?s test for outliers, which removes one outlier per
%       iteration based on hypothesis testing. 
%       - This method assumes that the data in datset is normally 
%       distributed.
%
% Input:
%       - dataset: NxM matrix (N:represent samples(observations), 
%       M:represent features).
%
% Output:
%       - Result: 1x2 cell array. Include two result;
%           + First array: Which observation include at least 1 outlier.
%           + Second array: The number of outliers that features have.
