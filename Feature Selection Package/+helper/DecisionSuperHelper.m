classdef DecisionSuperHelper
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Description:
%       Algorithm:
%       1. Select the feature(s) which is uncorrelated with others.
%       2. Select the best feature according to the feature selection 
%       method.
%       3. Clean the features which have high correlation between the
%       selected feature.
%       4. Turn step 2 and repeat the proccess until all features are
%       selected/cleaned.
%       5. Perform GQ Outlier Detection method and clean the featuers which
%       have no outlier.
% 
% Note:
%       - This class created in order to correlation cleaning and
%       organize feature rank.
%       - This class cannot be used by itself.
